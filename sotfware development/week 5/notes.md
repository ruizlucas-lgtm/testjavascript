# questions asked to ai
Iâ€™m making a console text adventure in Python for beginners. I need a simple map of 4â€“6 rooms, two items, and one math puzzle. Give me a concise pseudocode plan with named functions,

keep it pseudocode

# responces from ai 
Hereâ€™s a compact pseudocode plan you can use as a beginner-friendly roadmap for your text adventure:

### Pseudocode Plan

```
MAIN FUNCTION: game()
    setup_game()
    while game is not over:
        describe_current_room()
        get_player_input()
        process_command()
    end_game()

FUNCTION: setup_game()
    define rooms and their connections
    place items in rooms
    set starting room
    set puzzle status to unsolved

FUNCTION: describe_current_room()
    print room name and description
    list visible items
    show available exits

FUNCTION: get_player_input()
    ask player: "What do you want to do?"
    return command (e.g., "go north", "take key", "use item")

FUNCTION: process_command(command)
    if command starts with "go":
        move_player(direction)
    else if command starts with "take":
        take_item(item_name)
    else if command is "inventory":
        show_inventory()
    else if command is "solve puzzle":
        attempt_puzzle()
    else:
        print "I don't understand."

FUNCTION: move_player(direction)
    if direction is valid exit from current room:
        change current room
    else:
        print "You can't go that way."

FUNCTION: take_item(item_name)
    if item is in current room:
        add to inventory
        remove from room
    else:
        print "No such item here."

FUNCTION: show_inventory()
    print all items player has

FUNCTION: attempt_puzzle()
    ask math question (e.g., "What is 7 * 6?")
    if answer is correct:
        mark puzzle solved
        give reward (item or open locked room)
    else:
        print "Wrong answer, try again later."

FUNCTION: end_game()
    if puzzle solved and player reached final room:
        print "Congratulations! You win."
    else:
        print "Game over."
```

ðŸ’¡ Suggested beginner setup:

* **Rooms (5):** Hall, Kitchen, Study, Garden, Secret Room.
* **Items (2):** Key, Map.
* **Puzzle:** Locked door to Secret Room â†’ solve math question to unlock.

Would you like me to sketch out the **actual Python starter code** following this plan, or do you want to keep it at pseudocode for now?

Perfect â€” hereâ€™s a tightened version of the pseudocode, ready to guide coding without being overwhelming:

## Text Adventure Pseudocode (Beginner-Friendly)

```
MAIN FUNCTION: game()
    setup_game()
    while not game_over:
        describe_current_room()
        command = get_player_input()
        process_command(command)
    end_game()

FUNCTION: setup_game()
    create rooms (Hall, Kitchen, Study, Garden, Secret Room)
    connect rooms with exits
    place Key in Kitchen
    place Map in Study
    player starts in Hall
    puzzle_locked = True
    inventory = empty

FUNCTION: describe_current_room()
    print room name + description
    show items in room
    show available exits

FUNCTION: get_player_input()
    ask: "What do you want to do?"
    return command string

FUNCTION: process_command(command)
    if command starts with "go":
        move_player(direction)
    else if command starts with "take":
        take_item(item_name)
    else if command == "inventory":
        show_inventory()
    else if command == "solve puzzle":
        attempt_puzzle()
    else:
        print "Unknown command."

FUNCTION: move_player(direction)
    if direction is valid from current room:
        update current room
    else:
        print "Can't go that way."

FUNCTION: take_item(item_name)
    if item is in current room:
        add to inventory
        remove from room
    else:
        print "No such item here."

FUNCTION: show_inventory()
    print all items carried

FUNCTION: attempt_puzzle()
    if puzzle_locked:
        ask: "What is 12 + 8?"
        if answer is 20:
            unlock Secret Room
            puzzle_locked = False
            print "The locked door opens!"
        else:
            print "Wrong answer."
    else:
        print "Puzzle already solved."

FUNCTION: end_game()
    if in Secret Room and puzzle_locked == False:
        print "You win!"
    else:
        print "Game over."
```

Would you like me to also **draw a simple map diagram** (like ASCII-art) for the 5-room layout so itâ€™s easier for beginners to visualize how rooms connect?
